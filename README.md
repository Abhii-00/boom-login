### Project Description
[The "Boom" project is an interactive web application that masquerades as a secure login page but is, in fact, a showcase of creative and humorous front-end development. The core concept is to provide a "100% nonsense" user experience, as stated directly in the app's subtitle, by replacing the typical login process with a face-detection meme filter and video overlay.]
